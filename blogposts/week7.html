      <h5>Week 7 Reflection:</h5>
      <h3>Monday, April 14, 2025 & Wednesday April 16, 2025</h3>
      <hr class="solid" />
      <p>
        I presented my Milestone 2 Assignment during Monday's class. Prior to
        the presentation I conducted my second day of filming on Friday the 11th
        of April, which consisted of new locations and clips, due to the further
        development of my concept during week 6. I have included a few
        screenshots and some of my raw footage in the Google Drive link below.
        My videos do not include sound as I removed the microphone, it was a
        little obstructive to film with it on top of the camera.

        I have included my progress, alterations & plan, iterative testing ideas
        and updated community of practise from my Milestone 2 document
        submission below: <br /><br />
        Progress:As mentioned in assignment 1, I had initially planned to
        complete filming in weeks 4 and 5, however due to struggling with scene
        ideation and expansion on my main concept, I pushed filming to week 6,
        in which I made extensive progress in completing brainstorming and
        filming. I did not construct a storyboard as of yet as the ideas flowed
        naturally on the day of filming, walking around the locations and
        filming multiple scenes even if some were of an abstract nature. I have
        left the storyboard to the last step of my pre-production process due to
        the way in which I produce ideas, as they bloom during the time of
        reviewing footage and filming. My next step over week 7, is to review
        the new footage and compose a storyboard, by including or excluding
        footage and ensuring it surrounds the core concept of the project which
        is time, memory and yearn to remain in the past, simply put, the yearn
        to remain youthful. Following the story boarding stage, I will begin
        editing in week 8. In addition to my progress, I previously touched upon
        the general idea of my project however did not address a specific
        position of where I place myself amidst the realm of memory,
        aestheticism, the beauty of aging and the yearn to remain in the past. I
        place myself in accordance with reminiscing on the past and at times
        yearning to remain in the past. I see this as both carrying negative and
        positive connotations, as while reminiscing and yearning to remain in
        the past can be nostalgic and comforting, it can also be burdensome and
        restrictive when one cannot move forward, in some ways deserted in a dry
        land where wells of water will less likely be found. It is when one
        makes the choice to embrace the past while also moving forward in order
        to grow from it and progress, that they will find a well in the dry
        wilderness. Furthermore, in regards to the jealousy and obsession with
        remaining in the past youthful appearance, I place myself away from this
        as I believe it is a negative way to reminisce or remain in the past.
        This yearn can limit growth and gratitude for the natural process of
        aging and hence lead to a bitterness and intense lament about one’s
        appearance rather than a joyful embrace of our seasons of natural
        beauty. The Season of Yearning reflects this yearn to remain as a past
        self, both physically and internally. <br /><br />
        Alterations & Plan: I was initially indecisive about whether I should
        relate nature to my project and how this correlates with time, memory
        and yearn to remain in the past, however my view shifted towards
        aestheticism and the classical art of portraits. While impressionism
        will still remain as a concept it won’t be the main focal point. Last
        week while contemplating on scenes and locations to film, I subsequently
        decided on The Conservatory of the Fitzroy Gardens and the NGV. The
        Fitzroy Gardens was a new location where I took multiple shots of the
        surrounding natural areas and The Conservatory display of jungle leaves
        and greenery. Upon visiting, I also paid attention to the statues on
        display and captured their portrait representation. Statue figures had
        never crossed my mind till this moment and I attempted to take multiple
        angles as new concepts flowed during filming, in case they would be of
        meaningful use in my project. The previous footage which I filmed using
        my Canon DSLR camera will now not be incorporated into the project due
        to issues with the quality and light balance of the footage. My new
        footage is all filmed using the Sony PXW-x70, in 4K resolution.
        <br /><br />
        Iterative Testing Ideas: The process of ideation and expanding on a
        concept can be quite mind straining and dry at times. I felt lost for
        ideas as if stranded on a desertland, however through feedback and
        recommendations during class I found the water seeping through the land,
        which was to deepen the poetic connotations that I had initially
        visualised. The word “Reflections” became prominent and I further built
        upon this with visual representations of the word such as, glass
        windows, mirrors, glass panels and water which could also symbolise a
        canvas. <br /><br />
        Updates To Community of Practice: In assignment 1, I touched upon the
        two main art movements that will influence my project, Aestheticism and
        Impressionism. After filming last week, I encountered a new found
        concept which is to capture Aestheticism, art for the worth of beauty
        solely rather than a deeper meaning. Aestheticism became more suited
        towards the aged yet ageless nature of art and yearn to remain in the
        past. The significance of outward appearance rather than inner meaning
        and value. On the other hand Impressionism is the opposing art movement
        which I also would be interested in incorporating however this will be
        further developed through my storyboard process.

        <br />We started semester break on the 18th of April.
