      <h5>Week 5 Reflection:</h5>
      <h3>Monday, March 31, 2025 & Wednesday April 2, 2025</h3>
      <hr class="solid" />
      <p>
        As I was slightly behind, I worked on this prompt during class as we had
        around 15 minutes to finish it and prepare to share it. I also missed
        Wednesday's class this week. The theory was focused on Soundtrack and
        what is a soundtrack made of. A soundtrack is made up of, sound effects,
        voices and music. The sound effects include, background/ambient sounds,
        foley/sounds of actions on screen and designed/sound not from nature
        which is made up. Voices include, dialogue or any other voiced sounds.
        Additionally, music includes, diegetic source which are sounds existing
        within the world of the film and the score, which is music written
        specifically to accompany the video, an emotional translation of music.
        <br />
        During Monday's class we went through our answers to the Soundtrack
        Prompt which was: Annotate a 2 minute piece of video. It can be
        anything: video art, a segment of a film or television show, an advert,
        something online - any piece of moving image with a soundtrack. Take
        note of the following: - the number of sources of sound in the video -
        what are these different sources? - what purpose each type of sound
        plays in the video - how does sound help convey the meaning of the video
        - how does sound create the tone - anything else interesting you notice
        about how the soundtrack works with the image in your sample.

          >(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7YAuWOQUT4)&ensp;Interstellar -
          Cornfield Chase scene by Christopher Nolan (Soundtrack by Hans
          Zimmer).</strong
        >
        <br /><br />
        I have chosen the Cornfield Chase scene from Interstellar as Hans Zimmer
        is one of my favourite composers, as well as the film. There are around
        4 sources of sound in this scene however each sound gradually enters at
        different times. Evidently, there are poetic connotations that align
        with this idea of time and the way it is placed parallel with the
        soundtrack. The scene begins quite slowly, the soundtrack is low yet it
        is present giving the viewer a small sense that something is bound to
        happen. Following, there is a sudden onset of suspense, with a buildup
        towards the edge of a cliff which we as viewers did not expect would
        happen. The scene encapsulates how the characters are chasing time, the
        soundtrack exemplifies the tension and its melody is somewhat similar to
        steps or a clock. Each sound, the car driving through the cornfield, the
        plane flying above and the soundtrack all bring the suspense of the
        moment into close proximity.
