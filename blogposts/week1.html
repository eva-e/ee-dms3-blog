      <h5>Week 1 Reflection:</h5>
      <h3>Monday, March 3, 2025 & Wednesday March 5, 2025</h3>
      <hr class="solid" />
      <p>
        Monday of Week 1 was our introduction to video and video qualities
        class, as well as a camera and tripod class on Wednesday, where we
        learnt about tripod handling techniques and features of the Sony PXW-X70
        camera. During Monday's class, I worked on an in-class group activity.
        As a group we were assigned to the Voice/Witness quality of video. Go to
        We spent around 20 minutes reading through the Voice/Witness module and
        browsing the examples. After, my group brainstormed some examples of
        voice/witness that we have noticed in video or seen on tv, movies, art,
        ads, docs etc. As a group we made a list of all our examples, which
        included:
      </p>
      <li>Vlogs.</li>
      <li>Social Media.</li>
      <li>Daily Uni Life, Day in the life videos.</li>
      <li>Interviews, asking questions to strangers.</li>
      <li>Gabby documentary on Social Media, daily blogger.</li>
      <li>Situation draws attention because of a regular person.</li>
      <li>Social Media encourages people to share anything or everything.</li>
      <li>
        Encourages people to bring awareness to events or suspicions about
        certain topics.
      </li>
      <p>
        The task for Week 1 was a Video Diary, in which we had to share and take
        note of a video we have been watching recently. In Wednesday's
        practical, we discussed it as a class, each sharing our video. I hadn't
        been watching much lately, though I did watch a few clips of David
        Attenborough's Blue Planet. I took note of the documentary and how it is
        an example of Voice/Witness: <br /><br />
        Attenborough's nature focused documentaries capture the life of nature,
        witnessing first hand daily struggles and events of wildlife across the
        globe. Alongside capturing nature, David Attenborough's voice-over
        enhances the remarkable discoveries, as these commentaries allow viewers
        to gain comprehensive knowledge on nature which most have not
        encountered before. <br /><br />
        For our Wednesday practical we delved into the handling techniques of a
        tripod and guide to using the Sony PXW-X70 camera. It was my first time
        using this type of camera, an insightful learning experience. A few
        features of the camera which we covered included, Exposure/Iris, Shutter
        Speed, Gain, White Balance, Resolution and Mic inputs.
