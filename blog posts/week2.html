      <h5>Week 2 Reflection:</h5>
      <h3>Monday, March 10, 2025 & Wednesday March 12, 2025</h3>
      <hr class="solid" />
      <p>
        Week 2 was Lighting techniques week. During this week I followed the
        slides on Canvas and also completed the Lighting Prompt task, however I
        missed the Wednesday class due to being unwell. The theory covered was
        on lighting techniques in video and films. The lighting techniques
        included, three-point lighting, key-light, fill-light and back-light.
        Key-light is the primary source of light, such as a light which is
        overhead, mimicking the sun or indoors lights. The fill-light is at the
        same height as the subject and lightens up the shadows created by the
        key-light. Lastly the back/hair light separates the subject from the
        background, giving depth and highlight across the head and shoulders.
        This light source comes from above, behind to one side or the other,
        with the background lit separately. Another aspect is light temperature
        and white balance. The light temperature scale ranges from daylight,
        bright white and warm white. They can be distinguished by their moods,
        such as attentive for daylight, neutral for bright white and
        warm/inviting for warm white. As part of our weekly task, we were given
        a prompt task to then post on Canvas and discuss it next Monday in Week
        3. The prompt was: <br /><br />Find a piece of video/film footage with
        interesting lighting. What is it about the lighting that appeals to you?
        Describe it - what do you think the light source is? What is it meant to
        be in the context of the video/film? (i.e. what the source of the light
        appears to be in the world of the video, vs how the lighting effect was
        actually achieved) What effect does the lighting produce in the viewer -
        how does it make you feel? How does it affect the interpretation of the
        work? What does it conceal and what does it reveal?<br /><br />
