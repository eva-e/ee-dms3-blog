      <h5>Week 2 Reflection:</h5>
      <h3>Monday, March 10, 2025 & Wednesday March 12, 2025</h3>
      <hr class="solid" />
      <p>
        Week 2 was Lighting techniques week. During this week I followed the
        slides on Canvas and also completed the Lighting Prompt task, however I
        missed the Wednesday class due to being unwell. The theory covered was
        on lighting techniques in video and films. The lighting techniques
        included, three-point lighting, key-light, fill-light and back-light.
        Key-light is the primary source of light, such as a light which is
        overhead, mimicking the sun or indoors lights. The fill-light is at the
        same height as the subject and lightens up the shadows created by the
        key-light. Lastly the back/hair light separates the subject from the
        background, giving depth and highlight across the head and shoulders.
        This light source comes from above, behind to one side or the other,
        with the background lit separately. Another aspect is light temperature
        and white balance. The light temperature scale ranges from daylight,
        bright white and warm white. They can be distinguished by their moods,
        such as attentive for daylight, neutral for bright white and
        warm/inviting for warm white. <br />As part of our weekly task, we were
        given a prompt task last week to then post on Canvas and discuss it this
        week on Wednesday. The prompt was: <br /><br />Find a piece of
        video/film footage with interesting lighting. What is it about the
        lighting that appeals to you? Describe it - what do you think the light
        source is? What is it meant to be in the context of the video/film?
        (i.e. what the source of the light appears to be in the world of the
        video, vs how the lighting effect was actually achieved) What effect
        does the lighting produce in the viewer - how does it make you feel? How
        does it affect the interpretation of the work? What does it conceal and
        what does it reveal?<br /><br />

        <br />While I haven't watched this film as of yet, I was drawn to the
        poetic connotations of this scene, having searched for a scene which
        features a piano. Quite simply in this scene, more was said in the
        unsaid. The black and white films truly encapsulate the essence of
        lighting, as even in the absence of colour we are able to closely
        recognise the focus of an object in a scene in a more profound way.
        These films utilise lighting by spotlighting areas and gradients,
        bringing our attention to specific aspects of a scene which would differ
        to colour film. It is evident that there is a hanging light in the room,
        which reflects on Ilsa's hair. I love how when the frame is on Ilsa we
        can't see the main light source as it becomes a reflection from the lamp
        beside her. While Sam is playing “As Time Goes By” on the piano, Ilsa
        has her head facing slightly down, with the direction of her eyes
        towards the ground, hiding her tears from the light, however the light
        catches a small sparkle of her tear forming before she moves her head
        away. <br /><br />The main aspect of this scene between the lighting,
        emotions and music, is how in her silence, we are able to recognise
        Ilsa's sadness by the sparkle of light in her eyes. From her facial
        expression, there is a glimpse of sadness, reminiscence and yearn to
        return to the past, as her request to listen to this song once again
        hints at her nostalgia. I presume the song reminds her of a past memory
        that she is constantly thinking about, and longing to return to. Soon
        after, Rick enters the room, who I also presume is the man from her
        past. When she raises her eyes to him, the main light source fills her
        face and reveals her glassy eyes. Here I believe that there is a poetic
        and meaningful correlation between the lighting, her tears and relation
        to the man who entered the room. <br /><br />At first Ilsa was hiding
        her tears, the song was a symbol of her past and the sparkle of light
        was her longing, it was a small sparkle as she could not see the man who
        she longed for at that moment, however the shift happens when he
        suddenly enters the room, her eyes full of tears and the lighting in her
        eyes transitions from longing to confound and hopeful, her expression
        seemed startled. Upon viewing the scene for the first time I could sense
        Ilsa's strong emotions, by the connection of the song and the way the
        light captured her tears. Music is an array of emotions, especially the
        nostalgia it holds. We as viewers are guided towards an actor's
        emotional expression through lighting and are able to connect each
        aspect of the scene to understand their sentiment. The light,
        accompanied by music and the expression of emotions in silence, is
        subtle yet poetic. <br /><br />
        Our task for this week was to answer the Editing prompt in preparation
        for next week, Week 3. My answer has been documented into the Week 3
        post. The prompt was: <br />Annotate a 2 minute piece of video. It can
        be anything: video art, a segment of a film or television show, an
        advert, something online - any piece of moving image with cuts in it.
        Take note of the following: - the number and frequency of the cuts - the
        duration between the cuts - what purpose each cut serves - are
        transitions used or are they hard cuts? - how is time and space
        established via the cuts? - what are the relationship between shots -
        graphical, compositional, aesthetic etc - how does sound work with or
        against the cuts?
