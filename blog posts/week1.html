<!-- Week 1 was our camera and tripod class where we learnt about the tripod handling techniques 
 and features of the Sony PXW-X70 camera -->
<!-- We also discussed as a class a video or film we have been watching this week. I hadn't been watching much lately,
  though I did watch a few clips of David Attenborough's Blue Planet -->
