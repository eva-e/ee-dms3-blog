      <p>
        This Monday we continued working on our Assignment 2 in class. At this
        stage I was going through the footage I had taken on the 21st of March.
        My footage was quite jumbled and unorganised, lacking direction and a
        clear theme. I had taken a range of different paintings however they
        were Impressionism focused, which I initially believed would suit my
        concept. However, as I continued to contemplate deeper, I went past
        Impressionism and changed my concept focus towards Aestheticism, which I
        had also mentioned in my Initial Proposal. Aestheticism became well
        suited, as it is the art movement of beauty over meaning, the appearance
        and value of beauty holding a higher importance than the meaning or
        sentiment behind the art. On the 9th of April I reached this conclusion
        and decision and planned to film a second time on the 11th of April.
        Previously in my first filming session I used my Canon EOS 600D DSLR
        camera, however due to the resolution, the video showing coloured lines
        due to issue with matching the lighting frequency and not meeting my
        expectations or likings, I decided to borrow the Sony PXW-X70 from RMIT.
        <br />On Wednesday we had a guest speaker, the founder of Silky Jazz
        Films, Antuong Nguyen, talk about his journey in the field of Digital
        Media and Film Production. It was wonderful to see his highly impressive
        productions and commercials, which were insightful and inspiring to
        witness.
