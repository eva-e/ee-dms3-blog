      <h5>Week 12 Reflection:</h5>
      <h3>Wednesday May 28, 2025</h3>

      <p>
        I presented my video on Wednesday to the class, which was our Final
        Project Presentation. After receiving feedback about my voiceover having
        a slightly lower sound than the soundtrack, I edited the voiceover to be
        a little louder. As much as I didn't want my voice in the video, it
        assisted in carrying the message behind the video. I thoroughly enjoyed
        the production process of making this video and thankful for the
        constructive feedback and advice from both my lecturer Jessie and fellow
        peers.
