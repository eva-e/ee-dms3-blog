      <h5>Week 3 Reflection:</h5>
      <hr class="solid" />
      <h3>Monday, March 17, 2025 & Wednesday March 19, 2025</h3>
      <p>
        On Monday of week 3 we focused on continuity editing and formal
        continuity. Firstly we began by sharing our chosen video for the Editing
        Prompt Task which we received the week before. I chose The Wind Rises a
        Studio Ghibli Film. The prompt was: Annotate a 2 minute piece of video.
        It can be anything: video art, a segment of a film or television show,
        an advert, something online - any piece of moving image with cuts in it.
        Take note of the following: - the number and frequency of the cuts - the
        duration between the cuts - what purpose each cut serves - are
        transitions used or are they hard cuts? - how is time and space
        established via the cuts? - what are the relationship between shots -
        graphical, compositional, aesthetic etc - how does sound work with or
        against the cuts?<br /><br />

          by Hayao Miyazaki.</strong

        <br /><br />
        The duration between the cuts was quite short and featured around 21
        hard cuts with many quick cuts. There weren't any transitions included,
        as the focus was on the interaction between the two main characters.
        Each cut served to portray each character's role in this scene. The
        scene depicts the power of wind, able to make the paths of two strangers
        meet.
        <br /><br />
        The first few cuts reveal and somewhat foreshadow that the man's hat
        will fly away. It jumps from the woman to the man, signalling to the
        audience that there is an importance in their meeting. The purpose of
        the first several cuts is to establish the space between the characters
        and bring our attention to the very moment in front of us, as the scene
        does not change time or space and we are limited to the back of two
        train carriages.
        <br /><br />
        Many aesthetic cuts are added here which we can see by the book, the
        bridge below the train, the couplers holding each carriage and the hat
        being taken by the wind. These cuts focus away from the characters and
        underpin the objects of the scene which lead to the event of the
        characters meeting. All these aspects within the scene build the
        narrative of their interaction from beginning to end, though we are left
        eager to know when they will meet again.
        <br /><br />
        In 5 seconds of a part of the clip, there are 6 cuts, which displays how
        quickly the wind changes their situations, from enjoying the wind and
        reading a novel, to a dangerous encounter with death and rescuing a
        stranger's hat. The cuts here begin from the rapid speed of the train
        going over a bridge, the turning of the pages and finally his hat flying
        away. As rapid cuts are being shown, the sound also plays a part by
        increasing in volume, intensifying the scene, a slight warning to the
        audience that something is about to happen. It also indicates that a
        strong wind has risen, an indirect reference to the title, The Wind
        Rises.
        <br /><br />
        After their conversation there is a cut to the couplers which connect
        each carriage, once again making us aware that while separate, on
        different sides of the train, they are still joined together, hinting at
        the future of their relationship and possible second encounter. These
        scene cuts emphasise that while separated, there is still a connection
        present, a strong bond between each carriage and a bridge between them
        that may be crossed again, which evidently happens later in the film.
        The last cut is a wide shot, a third person view of the train travelling
        past fields of green. The scene embodies the main title and the power of
        wind in a poetic way.
