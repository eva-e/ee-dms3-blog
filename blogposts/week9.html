      <h5>Week 9 Reflection:</h5>
      <h3>Monday, May 5, 2025 & Wednesday May 7, 2025</h3>

        I attended my consultation session with Jessie on Wednesday. During the
        session, Jessie and I discussed my progress and how to overcome my
        struggle with structuring the video. I was given advice to go through
        each video on Premiere Pro and decide whether I will keep or remove it
        from the video, as well as printing still images from the videos and
        placing them in front of me similar to a pin board or mood board and
        piece the scenes together using still images. I was also recommended to
        choose a soundtrack prior to structuring the video, which was very
        helpful. I took all feedback and advice on board, proceeding with
        composing a soundtrack prior to structuring the video.
