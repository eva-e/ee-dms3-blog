      <h5>Week 4 Reflection:</h5>
      <h3>Monday, March 24, 2025 & Wednesday March 26, 2025</h3>
      <hr class="solid" />
      <p>
        On Wednesday I presented my Initial Response presentation. I did not
        attend Monday's class due to being unwell and was yet to complete my
        presentation preparation. I was trailing behind for much of the semester
        with this video assignment as I struggled to conceptualise my ideas and
        produce a storyboard beforehand, leading to the structure of my
        pre-production being disorderly. <br />
        I began planning my initial proposal on the 22nd of March as this was
        the day I was finally set on an idea. On the 20th of March I had a focus
        on art and nature and started by opening Notes on my phone and jotting
        down each and every word or phrase that came to mind. I was filling the
        page with several poetic quotes that I came up with and from there I
        went further in depth with the concept. After I had come to the
        conclusion of choosing obsession with art and ones appearance, I went
        for my first filming session on the 21st of March to the NGV. I
        remembered a novel I had started reading in high school, in Year 10 of
        2020, however I only read the first chapter, which was The Picture of
        Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. This novel closely relates to my concept as
        there is an overwhelming focus on the main character's appearance and
        obsession with remaining youthful, jealous of the canvas. As part of my
        Community of Practise I included this novel as holding similar themes to
        my video project, in which I further represented the themes of memory,
        nostalgia and time. I love poetry and the ability to convey ones values
        and emotions through words from the heart in a way that is resonant and
        heart-warming, yet also able to confront societal norms and embrace
        morals. I have included the notes I took down below: <br /><br />
        The landscape represents yearn to return to a past moment, The Aged, yet
        ageless nature of art, leading to the yearn to remain youthful. The
        canvas reveals to us many revelations, it is a thieving mirror, able to
        take what once was ours in a moment, now stolen forever. Becoming
        jealous of its ability, a poisonous trap. Perspective and appreciation,
        at the core of this entanglement. <br /><br />

        Slow motion Still life and still motion Shots of the gallery hallways
        from the doorways, level 2 and 3 Individual artworks, Fruit, nature
        Monet The Season of Yearning Focus on Age, Growth and Disregarding the
        waves of society. Obsession with self. Society presently holds this
        obsession. We reminisce, as the canvas holds a past memory, it too, is
        unchanging and eternally embroidered in our hearts. The canvas is an
        encapsulation of the sentiment of a moment. While in that very moment it
        was created it held a sentiment far different to how it is felt
        presently and in years to come. As one views it another connects to it.
        It becomes more than a mere sighting. As the eye is the beginning of all
        perceptions, it is also the path to memory just as the other senses.
        Leading to sound, these two, sound and sight, will never cease to be
        connected. Their distance is out measured by their proximity. Far yet
        near. There is always something to hide behind. <br /><br />
        The film is about the yearn to remain unchanged and youthful, it touches
        upon the natural journey of growth we have as individuals day by day. A
        canvas remains with its colours they neither fade nor age nor grow,
        however its essence grows on us. We yearn to be as the canvas, putting
        an overwhelming focus on oneself, rather than being selfless. Though the
        scene in front of us has aged it remains in its time, a capsule per se.
        The canvas is to admire the beauties of Impressionism rather than become
        jealous of it. <br /><br />
        It is a video poem, which draws our attention to false narratives about
        classical art, some view it as a tedious act, lacking enjoyment, others
        jealous of its ability to remain in its time, aged yet unchanging,
        however we must be encouraged to view classical art as a way to
        appreciate the connection between nature, art and growth. Nature teaches
        us how we must bloom and grow, art simulates it in a way that sometimes
        cannot be comprehended; we view it in awe, as it replicates the beauties
        of life around us. The seasons change and the viewer ages, yet the face
        of the exhibit remains unwavering, a gain and a loss it becomes unfair,
        unmatched. They desire to be the canvas, aged yet unchanging, unwavering
        amidst the changing of seasons. Film about the relation between nature
        and art Impressionism. How art is a reflection of life, it brings a
        softness. <br />
