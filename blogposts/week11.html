      <h5>Week 11 Reflection:</h5>
      <h3>Monday, May 19, 2025 & Wednesday May 21, 2025</h3>
      <hr class="solid" />
      <p>
        On May the 26th and 27th I began editing and composing the soundtrack. I
        was in a tight situation as I had been struggling to create a narrative
        order for my footage and decide on a soundtrack. The process that I
        followed was unusual and disorderly however I will explain it here in my
        reflection. <br />
        It is evident I was extremely behind. From the feedback in week 9, I
        worked on a mixture of soundtrack composition and watching a few scenes
        at a time. I started on my piano by composing a simple melody for an
        intro and title screen. As I was composing the simple melody I went
        through the videos and chose which clip was suitable for a title screen,
        able to clearly show the title and introduce the location, similar to an
        Establishing Shot. <br />
        I was happy with the hallway/entrance to a room in the NGV which had a
        pleasing symmetrical aesthetic, revealing three artworks. While playing
        the title video on loop countless times, I was playing the simple piano
        melody. The melody sparked another idea for the next sequence of videos.
        As this melody was quite repetitive I decided to make a fast montage of
        different clips, with the melody also increasing in speed to correlate
        with the speed of the montage. Next I created something similar to a
        drop, where the music drops from its momentum to a soft ambience of
        strings and piano melody. I was working with two screens, one laptop
        recording the sounds on FL Studio and the other showing Premiere Pro
        with the video timeline and edits. After this sequence I proceeded to
        choose videos to fill in my timeline. However before proceeding to the
        next sequence I composed the whole soundtrack. I imported the soundtrack
        which was around 2 minutes and 30 seconds in length and went by this
        length to fill in the timeline with videos. Lastly, I repeated the fast
        montage from the beginning to bring the portraits back into perspective,
        a reminder to the audience of this obsession to remain youthful, however
        naturally we are ever changing, hence the rapid nature of this montage
        and change between portraits hinting at how our appearance changes.
