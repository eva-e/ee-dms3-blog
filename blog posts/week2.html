        Week 2 was Lighting techniques week. I attended the first class however
        missed the second class due to being unwell. In Monday's class the

<!-- Week 2 was Lighting techniques week. 
 I attended the first class however missed the second class due to being unwell. 
 In Monday's class the theory was on lighting techniques in video and films. 
 We were given a prompt task to then post on Canvas and discuss it next Monday in Week 3.
 The prompt was:
 Find a piece of video/film footage with interesting lighting. 
 What is it about the lighting that appeals to you? Describe it - 
 what do you think the light source is? What is it meant to be in the context of the video/film? 
 (i.e. what the source of the light appears to be in the world of the video, vs how the lighting effect was actually achieved) 
 What effect does the lighting produce in the viewer - 
 how does it make you feel? How does it affect the interpretation of the work? 
 What does it conceal and what does it reveal?  -->
<!-- I chose The Wind Rises a Studio Ghibli Film (I will add my answer in once I have written the css code for each page) -->
