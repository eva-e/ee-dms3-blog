      <h5>Week 4 Reflection:</h5>
      <h3>Monday, March 24, 2025 & Wednesday March 26, 2025</h3>
      <hr class="solid" />
      <p>
        On Wednesday I presented my Initial Response presentation. I did not
        attend Monday's class due to being unwell and was yet to complete my
        presentation preparation. I was trailing behind for much of the semester
        with this video assignment as I struggled to conceptualise my ideas and
        produce a storyboard beforehand, leading to the structure of my
        pre-production being disorderly. I began planning my initial proposal on
        the 22nd of March as this was the day an idea finally arrived. My focus
        was on art and nature and I started by opening Notes on my phone and
        jotting down each and every word or phrase that came to mind.
