      <h5>Week 3 Reflection:</h5>
      <h3>Monday, March 17, 2025 & Wednesday March 19, 2025</h3>
      <hr class="solid" />
      <p>
        On Monday of week 3 we focused on Continuity Editing and Formal
        Continuity. Firstly we began by sharing our chosen video for the Editing
        Prompt Task which we received the week before. After, we went through
        theory on both Continuity Editing and Formal Continuity. Continuity
        Editing is driven by narrative shots, which enables the audience to
        assume or predict the next shot, maintaining consistency with shots
        also. The styles of Continuity Editing include, Eyeline Match, Match on
        Action, Establishing Shot, POV Shot, Axis of Angle, Close-up/Extreme
        Close-up, Mid Shot, Wide Shot and Parallel Editing/Cross-cutting.
        Additionally we went through the Formal Continuity styles, which use the
        elements of speed, duration, lighting and colour, to bring the shots
        into relationship with each other, which forms meaning for the audience,
        rather than narrative driven shots. Formal Continuity styles include,
        Graphical, Aesthetic. Rhythm/Movement, Tempo and Spatial. <br />In
        regards to my Editing Prompt which I shared on Monday, I chose The Wind
        Rises, a Studio Ghibli Film. The prompt was: <br />
        Annotate a 2 minute piece of video. It can be anything: video art, a
        segment of a film or television show, an advert, something online - any
        piece of moving image with cuts in it. Take note of the following: - the
        number and frequency of the cuts - the duration between the cuts - what
        purpose each cut serves - are transitions used or are they hard cuts? -
        how is time and space established via the cuts? - what are the
        relationship between shots - graphical, compositional, aesthetic etc -
        how does sound work with or against the cuts?<br /><br />

        <strong
          >(https://youtu.be/eJ3WYCZuKbAA)&ensp;A Studio Ghibli Film - The Wind
          Rises by Hayao Miyazaki.</strong
        >
        <br /><br />
        The duration between the cuts was quite short and featured around 21
        hard cuts with many quick cuts. There weren't any transitions included,
        as the focus was on the interaction between the two main characters.
        Each cut served to portray each character's role in this scene. The
        scene depicts the power of wind, able to make the paths of two strangers
        meet.
        <br /><br />
        The first few cuts reveal and somewhat foreshadow that the man's hat
        will fly away. It jumps from the woman to the man, signalling to the
        audience that there is an importance in their meeting. The purpose of
        the first several cuts is to establish the space between the characters
        and bring our attention to the very moment in front of us, as the scene
        does not change time or space and we are limited to the back of two
        train carriages.
        <br /><br />
        Many aesthetic cuts are added here which we can see by the book, the
        bridge below the train, the couplers holding each carriage and the hat
        being taken by the wind. These cuts focus away from the characters and
        underpin the objects of the scene which lead to the event of the
        characters meeting. All these aspects within the scene build the
        narrative of their interaction from beginning to end, though we are left
        eager to know when they will meet again.
        <br /><br />
        In 5 seconds of a part of the clip, there are 6 cuts, which displays how
        quickly the wind changes their situations, from enjoying the wind and
        reading a novel, to a dangerous encounter with death and rescuing a
        stranger's hat. The cuts here begin from the rapid speed of the train
        going over a bridge, the turning of the pages and finally his hat flying
        away. As rapid cuts are being shown, the sound also plays a part by
        increasing in volume, intensifying the scene, a slight warning to the
        audience that something is about to happen. It also indicates that a
        strong wind has risen, an indirect reference to the title, The Wind
        Rises.
        <br /><br />
        After their conversation there is a cut to the couplers which connect
        each carriage, once again making us aware that while separate, on
        different sides of the train, they are still joined together, hinting at
        the future of their relationship and possible second encounter. These
        scene cuts emphasise that while separated, there is still a connection
        present, a strong bond between each carriage and a bridge between them
        that may be crossed again, which evidently happens later in the film.
        The last cut is a wide shot, a third person view of the train travelling
        past fields of green. The scene embodies the main title and the power of
        wind in a poetic way. <br /><br />
        Furthermore, on Wednesday I participated in another group task which was
        a practical, shooting to edit. We were allocated into groups of 3 or 4.
        Part of the task was to choose 5 Continuity Editing styles for our
        video. Our group chose, POV, Close-up, Wide Shot, Establishing Shot and
        Match on Action. <br /><br />The concept was on a student discovering
        posters in RMIT, however they were alone. We used Close-up shots to
        encapsulate the students emotions of both sadness and longing,
        especially how the light reflects in their eyes as they gaze upon the
        posters. We also included multiple Match on Action shots which displayed
        the continuous journey of the student, leaving one scene and picking up
        where they left off in another, from the hallway, to the staircase and
        finally at the wall of posters. It may have seemed like the staircase
        led to that wall of posters however those two scenes were not a
        continuation of the same area, it was the continuation of the shot
        however at a different location. While this may not seem consistent, we
        attempted to create consistency by implying the student had arrived at
        the top of the same staircase and encountered the wall of posters. The
        staircase was in Building 13 level 1 and the wall of posters in Building
        9 level 1 staircase. The soundtrack is a non-copyright song from
        Youtube, called Hopeful by Cool Cinema. I have linked our group video
        below through Google Drive: <br /><br />
